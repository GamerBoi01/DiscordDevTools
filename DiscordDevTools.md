Get DevTools For Discord



Type on the inspect element console on your browser:

Object.defineProperty((webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.isDeveloper!==void 0).exports.default,"isDeveloper",{get:()=>true});


But you need big brain stuff to use these. Also don't mind the last added feature to your discord.com, It's just for boosting but it's normal boosting where you need to pay.
